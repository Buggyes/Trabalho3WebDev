## problem 1
An employee management website that uses a .json file as it's database. You first have to log in with the user "admin" and use the password "123". Once you're in, you'll see that you can add, update and delete employees.
To run this, you'll need a way to run the server (like the VSCode extension Live Server), and the json-server package from npm.

## problem 2
It's a gif searching website. It uses the Giphy API, and you can either search a gif in particular, look up a random gif, or see the trending gifs.
